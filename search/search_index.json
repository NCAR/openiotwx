Because Open IoTwx relies on an MQTT protocol, it must send its data to a broker.</p> <p>Each station is, in the IoT view, a client. Whatever platform you choose to interact with the data from  your station on is also a client. To go between clients, a broker is required. In our opinion,   CHORDS, is your best option for  doing that. CHORDS serves as the broker, essentially an intersection that your data gets sent to and  away from, as well as, if you want, the client. CHORDS allows for data visualization, download (in many   formats), and more. Your data can be sent to the Open IoTwx client, and be published with the other  open-data stations, or put onto your own server, where you have complete autonomy over the data  that you collect. It is completely your choice.</p> <p>Follow the steps on CHORDS if you wish to use it as a service. Their documentation is quite   user-friendly.</p> <p>While Open IoTwx is in favor of public data, in the same way we believe in open software and   knowledge in general, we understand that many communities have had data systematically   used against them, and thus want control over it.

Our community includes  students, faculty, and staff from community colleges and universities, citizen  scientists, and other interested community members.</p> <p>Historically, the same communities that aren\u2019t represented in climate and  geosciences are the ones that are least resilient and most at risk of  significant impact from climate change. </p> <p>Furthermore, such communities are often over-represented when looking at  so-called \"data deserts\" and gaps in observation networks. These communities  are at continued risk of the worst outcomes of climate change, and communities  in data deserts are often under-represented in climate change science and  policy discussions, STEM fields, and in the ongoing open source IoT revolution.

It allows for ubiquitous, low-cost, and high quality measurements of many things, including our Earth system. Due to low cost-barriers, these sensing systems are now broadly accessible to many communities. We hope that openIoTwx can continue piquing new interest in measurements and data relating to the all aspects of our environment around us. We advise all members of our community to review and regularly reflect on the core ideals outlined here.</p> <p>The goals and core ideals of the openIoTwx project is to advance low cost IoT based geoscience observational projects via four objectives that align with and build upon the National Science Foundation's (NSF) investments in the EarthCube Community, ACCESS/Jetstream, 3D printed weather stations (aka \"openIoTWx\") and future needs:</p> <p>(1) create an open, diverse, community-driven and community-managed ecosystem to empower fledgling open source sensor projects for open environmental sensing.</p> <p>(2) implement an efficient, scalable, and simplified open project submission and contribution framework to provide equitable access across disciplines, stakeholders, institutions, and demographics to grow a community managed suite of open source IoT observational sensor network projects;</p> <p>(3) building upon NSF\u2019s Cloud-Hosted Real-time Data Services for the Geosciences (CHORDS) and other components, develop a robust, decentralized, and flexible community software contribution platform to bring the open source project development and design cycle into a new collaborative and cooperative environment to spur sustainable community growth; </p> <p>(4) provide cyber-infrastructure (CI) integration through the ACCESS innovation pilot program to manage dataflows, analysis, address artificial intelligence and machine learning of earth science time series streams, creating open source community deployments that are accessible while recognizing and honoring data sovereignty aspects of our communities.</p>"},{"location":"introduction/ideals/#opensource-is-at-our-core","title":"Opensource is at our core","text":"<p>Our community holds the ideals of open source technology very close (for more see https://opensource.org). openIoTwx broadly promotes the MIT open source license and is accessible to all for non-commercial use.

This is achieved through our portable,  modular, and affordable platform. openIoTwx can be installed with up to 7  sensors or \"nodes.\" These nodes include, but are not limited to: temperature, relative  humidity, pressure, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), digital rain sensors, sky  cameras, and sonic anemometers (Devices that measure wind speed). The platform is  small enough to mount anywhere using low cost commercial off-the-shelf materials and  3D printed parts.</p> <p>Any of these nodes can be attached to the body using universal one inch screw-in  connectors. This approach allows for any 1\" PVC pipe or other threaded connector to be  used as a base for the station. This specification was chosen due to how commonly  available it is to find components that fit. The body of the station has threaded  connectors. Depending on the housing used, there are between three and five ports. </p> <p>Users are provided with a starter set of screw in adaptors for an initial  set of sensors such as the RG15 digital rain sensor,  air quality monitor, and radiation shields. We also provide screw-in connectors with a  cap so that users can cap off connectors not in use and deploy. This prevents water and  dust from getting into the electronics. Should a user want to attach a new sensor, they  can modify the 3D design files (provided in the print section) for whatever their  needs demand.</p>"}]}
