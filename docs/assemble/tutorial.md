# Video Tutorials

Here, youâ€™ll find step-by-step videos that complement our written and photographic instructions for building your weather station. These tutorials offer a visual guide to help you navigate the assembly process, providing helpful tips and insights along the way. You can build the weather station's core unit and power by watching these videos or following our written instructions in the next pages, or by using both as a resource.

[Core Station Assembly Tutorial:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8jn9YEWNgk)
This video contains instructions to assemble a basic model of the IoT weather station with four sensors: rain gauge, air quality, temperature/pressure/humidity, and UV. We encourage you to explore and iterate on this design once you understand the principle structure. If you would like to add more sensors, any Qwiic compatible, I2C, sensors can be daisy-chained or connected to another splitter if needed.
