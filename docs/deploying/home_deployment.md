When deploying a weather station at a home, school, or in an otherwise developed area, there are a few important considerations to keep in mind. Firstly, choose a location that is free from immediate obstructions such as nearby trees or tall structures that could affect other weather measurements. Ensure that the station is not in direct contact with the building or any heat-emitting sources that could impact temperature readings. It is recommended to position the weather station in an area that receives adequate sunlight and is representative of the general microclimate of your surroundings. Avoid placing the station in shaded areas or near reflective surfaces that could distort solar radiation measurements. Additionally, make sure the station is securely mounted, taking into account factors like stability and ease of access for maintenance. Regular checks and comparisons with nearby official weather sources can help ensure the accuracy of the collected data.
