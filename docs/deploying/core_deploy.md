## Field Deployment

Properly situating a weather station in the field requires careful consideration for accurate data collection. When selecting a location, keep in mind a few important factors. Place the weather station away from obstacles like tall trees or buildings that can disrupt airflow and affect wind measurements. Avoid areas with artificial heat sources such as asphalt or concrete, as they can cause higher temperature readings. Also, make sure to position the station on stable ground to prevent measurement errors and ensure equipment stability. Mount the station at a suitable height, typically 1.5 to 2 meters above the ground, for reliable data.

## Home, Urban, or School Deployment

When deploying a weather station at a home, school, or in an otherwise developed area, there are a few important considerations to keep in mind. Firstly, choose a location that is free from immediate obstructions such as nearby trees or tall structures that could affect other weather measurements. Ensure that the station is not in direct contact with the building or any heat-emitting sources that could impact temperature readings. It is recommended to position the weather station in an area that receives adequate sunlight and is representative of the general microclimate of your surroundings. Avoid placing the station in shaded areas or near reflective surfaces that could distort solar radiation measurements. Additionally, make sure the station is securely mounted, taking into account factors like stability and ease of access for maintenance. Regular checks and comparisons with nearby official weather sources can help ensure the accuracy of the collected data.
