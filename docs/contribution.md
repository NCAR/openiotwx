# Contributing to this Project

We welcome any and all contributions. We'd love not only to see pictures of your builds and the data
that you produce (if you're willing to share), but also support for new sensors, new 3d designs for 
parts, and any feedback you have.

This [google form](https://forms.gle/mJmh5QLR8TvUpvbg8) is the best way to contribute non-code items. 
For code, stls, etc. please send pull requests for this repo(LINK,LINK,LINK)

Pieces we would love for you to contribute:

* A housing and sensor system for measuring atmospheric pollutants
* A low cost and low complexity method for getting anemometry
* Water quality / PFAS sensor integration
