# Contributing to this Project

We welcome any and all contributions. We'd love not only to see pictures of your builds and the data
that you produce (if you're willing to share), but also support for new sensors, new 3d designs for 
parts, and any feedback you have.

This google form (LINK,LINK,LINK) is the best way to contribute things other than code. For code, 
stls, etc. please send pull requests for this repo(LINK,LINK,LINK)
