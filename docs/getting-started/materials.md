# Materials

Within this page you can see all of the required materials for building the base unit, as 
well as the materials for adding sensors and other 'accessory' nodes. If you already have some of 
these pieces, for example, a 3d printer, you don't need to factor that into the cost. We have 
included every sensor that we currently support for the station within this list. If you have other 
sensors you wish to include, we would be thrilled for you to send that to us via our [Contribution](../contribution.md) portal.
