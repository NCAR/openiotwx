# Computing

A driving principle of OpenIoTwx is accessibility.
Because of this we have kept requirements low.
Required: Operating computer (because of our love for open source software,
we suggest Linux, Mac and Windows work as well), a monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse.  
Additionally, for the preliminary downloads, applications, etc, you will need a moderately stable
internet connection OR a flashdrive containing everything within the software (LINK, LINK, LINK) 
and the core installation (LINK, LINK, LINK) pages.
