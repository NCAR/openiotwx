# Software

First, download Arduino 1.8.18. This is an old release but in order to use the correct data 
format, SPIFFS, you must use Arduino 1.8. If this is changed in Arduino IDE, 
IoTWX will adapt accordingly.

Additionally you will need Ultimaker Cura (or a different 3d printing software) if you want
to work with and edit the 3d files. You will need to do this if you have special circumstances for 
your station site or you are using a different prrinter than the one we suggest. Our gcode files 
(instructions for the 3d printing) are calibrated with our printer, the Ender 3 S1.
