# Community

openIoTwx is made up of a diverse community who all contribute in unique and
substantive ways to build, customize, and deploy open source 3D printed weather
stations that are accessible and equitable for all researchers no matter the
size of the institution, the scale of the planned work, the discipline of the
research, or the demographics of the requestor. All are welcome. No advanced
degree in computer science or engineering is needed to build or contribute to
this project. Our community members include students, faculty, and staff from
community colleges, universities, citizen scientists, and others interested
community members.

Historically, the same communities under-represented in climate and geosciences,
are also those least resilient and most at risk of significant impact from
climate change.  Furthermore, such communities are often over-represented when
looking at so-called "data deserts" and gaps in observation networks.  These
communities are at continued risk of the worst outcomes of climate change, and
communities in data deserts are often under-represented in climate change
science and policy discussions, STEM fields, and in the ongoing open source IoT
revolution. Our open IoT community will contribute to the development of a
democratized, diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce, providing
opportunities to immediately translate interest into climate change resiliency,
data analysis and management.
