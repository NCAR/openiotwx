# Printing out the station

Attached in this document are all of the .stl (3d printing files) and .step
(3d design files) for every node. 

While we didn't feel it made sense to share gcodes for the various printing
operations, here are some thoughts for settings:
1. Stay fairly near manufacturers suggestions for temps unless you are a seasoned 3-d printer.
2. Lower support densities and/or use tree supports to save material, limit post-processing, and increase print quality.
3. Print multiple parts at once. It saves time.
4. Print the cap and lid lock for air quality sideways, it'll increase quality significantly.
